### **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic to me that was covered throughout my domain research on digital twins was the strategies for multimodality in building a clinical digital twin. Researchers have built frameworks that combine electronic health records, wearable sensors, and other sources of continuous time-series signals to train a digital twin capable of risk prediction and prevention.

### **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I potentially want to investigate developing a diagnostic patient-specific digital twin that monitors cardiovascular status through continuous ECG and physiological data integration to detect cardiac abnormalities, generate structured diagnostic reports, and forecast risk of events such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmia deterioration.

### **3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

In Q1 we will be focusing on figuring out how to process both ECG signals and EHR data to build a baseline model/framework for a cardiovascular digital twin. Next quarter, we will investigate more complex models to make a wider range of predictions; we also potentially want to explore creating a model that can simulate ECG signals given certain clinical information and EHR.

### **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

We are interested in investigated using LLM text techniques to classify ECG data, a physiological simulation engine to provide more context to the clinical digital twin, and some sort of reinforcement/continuous learning to tune model paramters, basically integrating AI-ML based patient modelling with ground truth contextual information to create a reliable, holistic, digital-twin.
